# polygo
3D polygoniser from function definition.

Creates 3D triangle mesh from symbolic expression.
Gui based on Dear ImGui.

the whole application code is in a single file (polygo.cpp) to make it easy to experement with,
the parsing and polygonisation code can be used without the gui code but commenting out the APPLICATION_CODE macro at the beginning of this file.
